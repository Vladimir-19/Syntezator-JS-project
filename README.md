# Syntezator-JS-project
 This is a digital synthesizer app based on Tone.js (Web Audio API library). A synthesizer is an electronic musical instrument that generates audio signals. Users can play melodies using a standard QWERTY keyboard or mouse.

Tone.js is a very popular Web Audio API library 
The Web Audio API provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the Web, allowing developers to choose audio sources, add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, apply spatial effects (such as panning) and much more.
